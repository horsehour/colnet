dimensions for random walks on random-walk chains","description":"The probability distribution of random walks on linear structures generated by random walks in $d$-dimensional space, $P_d(r,t)$, is analytically studied for the case $\\xi\\equiv r/t^{1/4}\\ll1$. It is shown to obey the scaling form $P_d(r,t)=\\rho(r) t^{-1/2} \\xi^{-2} f_d(\\xi)$, where $\\rho(r)\\sim r^{2-d}$ is the density of the chain. Expanding $f_d(\\xi)$ in powers of $\\xi$, we find that there exists an infinite hierarchy of critical dimensions, $d_c=2,6,10,\\ldots$, each one characterized by a logarithmic correction in $f_d(\\xi)$. Namely, for $d=2$, $f_2(\\xi)\\simeq a_2\\xi^2\\ln\\xi+b_2\\xi^2$; for $3\\le d\\le 5$, $f_d(\\xi)\\simeq a_d\\xi^2+b_d\\xi^d$; for $d=6$, $f_6(\\xi)\\simeq a_6\\xi^2+b_6\\xi^6\\ln\\xi$; for $7\\le d\\le 9$, $f_d(\\xi)\\simeq a_d\\xi^2+b_d\\xi^6+c_d\\xi^d$; for $d=10$, $f_{10}(\\xi)\\simeq a_{10}\\xi^2+b_{10}\\xi^6+c_{10}\\xi^{10}\\ln\\xi$, {\\it etc.\\/} In particular, for $d=2$, this implies that the temporal dependence of the probability density of being close to the origin $Q_2(r,t)\\equiv P_2(r,t)/\\rho(r)\\simeq t^{-1/2}\\ln t$.","publicationCount":0,"publicationCountByYear":[],"citationCnt":1,"citationCountByYear":[],"rank":22870.0,"entityType":0},"dataVersion":"2019-01-11-prod"}

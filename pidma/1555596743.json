We develop an analytical framework for studying a network formed bynfully interdependent randomly connected networks, each composed of the same number of nodesN .T he dependency links connecting nodes from different networks establish au nique one-to-one correspondence between the nodes of one network and the nodes of the other network. We study the dynamics of the cascades of failures in such a network of networks (NON) caused by a random initial attack on one of the networks, after which a fractionpof its nodes survives. We find for the fully interdependent loopless NON that the final state of the NON does not depend on the dynamics of the cascades but is determined by a uniquely defined mutual giant component of the NON, which generalizes both the giant component of regular percolation of a single network (n=1) and the recently studied case of the mutual giant component of two interdependent networks (n=2). We also find that the mutual giant component does not depend on the topology of the NON and express it in terms of generating functions of the degree distributions of the network. Our results show that, for anyn!2 there exists a criticalp=p c >0 below which the mutual giant component abruptly collapses from a finite nonzero value forp!p c to zero for p< p c , as in a first-order phase transition. This behavior holds even for scale-free networks wherep c = 0f orn=1. We show that, if at least one of the networks in the NON has isolated or singly connected nodes, the NON completely disintegrates for sufficiently largen even ifp=1. In contrast, in the absence of such nodes, the NON survives for anynfor sufficiently largep. We illustrate this behavior by comparing two exactly solvable examples of NONs composed of Erd ˝ ´ enyi (ER) and random regular (RR) networks. We find that the robustness ofncoupled RR networks of degreekis dramatically higher compared to then-coupled ER networks of the same average degree ¯ k=k.

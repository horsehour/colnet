A large number of real networks are called “scale-free” because they show a power-law distribution of the number of links per node [1, 5, 6]. However, it is widely believed that complex networks are not length-scale invariant or self-similar. This conclusion originates from the “small-world” property of these networks, which implies that the number of nodes increases exponentially with the “diameter” of the network [7–10], rather than the power-law relation expected for a self-similar structure. Nevertheless, here we present a novel approach to the analysis of such networks, revealing that their structure is indeed self-similar. This result is achieved by the application of a renormalization procedure which coarse-grains the system into boxes containing nodes within a given ”size”. Concurrently, we identify a power-law relation between the number of boxes needed to cover the network and the size of the box defining a finite self-similar exponent. These fundamental properties, which are shown for the WWW, social, cellular and protein-protein interaction networks, help to understand the emergence of the scale-free property in complex networks. They suggest a common self-organization dynamics of diverse networks at different scales into a critical state and in turn bring together previously unrelated fields: the statistical physics of complex networks with renormalization group, fractals and critical phenomena.","publicationCount":0,"publicationCountByYear":[],"citationCnt":4,"citationCountByYear":[],"rank":21684.0,"entityType":0},"dataVersion":"2019-01-11-prod"}

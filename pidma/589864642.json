Curing as a New Tool for Infrastructural Renewal: Reducing Repair Congestion, Increasing Service Life, and Improving Sustainability","description":"Internal curing has recently been developed as a new concrete technology that has the potential to dramatically extend the service life of concrete infrastructure elements like bridge decks. Internal curing uses prewetted lightweight aggregate (LWA) in low water to cement ratio, high performance concrete (HPC) to provide curing water at the opportune time to minimize restrained shrinkage cracking and increase hydration of the cement resulting in reduced chloride ingress and corrosion. Internal curing may be able to extend the service life of a concrete deck. The benefits of internally cured concrete bridge decks (either new or replacements) at a system level, in the context of traffic disruptions resulting from renewal/repair needs and varying traffic flow congestion levels across different timescales, is a relatively unexplored concept. This research seeks to understand the potential benefits of internally cured concrete mixtures compared to conventional mixture in a transportation system, thereby filling a key gap in the current internal curing literature. Findings from this research are as follows: Internal curing generally results in a significant reduction in cracking as well as an improvement in the transport properties of concrete. These benefits are due in part to the reduced self-dessication, extended degree of hydration and the densification of the interfacial regions around the LWA. It was shown that for the service life model presented herein the internally cured HPC concretes cast in the state of Indiana in 2013 achieve an estimated service life improvement of 3 to 4.5 times that of the conventional bridge deck concrete specified, while a field inspection of one of these bridges indicated no visible shrinkage cracking after six months of service. Recommendations are as follows: The research addressed in this project suggests that internally cured concrete mixtures can represent an important and viable option for a transportation system to replace conventional concrete mixtures. Further, this research serves as a building block for exploring a new generation of analytical frameworks for application of internally cured concrete mixture.","publicationCount":0,"publicationCountByYear":[],"citationCnt":0,"citationCountByYear":[],"rank":21701.0,"entityType":0},"dataVersion":"2019-01-11-prod"}

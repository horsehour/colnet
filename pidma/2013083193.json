DOI: 10.1063/1.2176912 Granular metals consist of composite mixtures of metal and nonmetal materials. When the metal concentration is small the metal forms small islands embedded in an insulat- ing matrix. In this configuration the electric conductivity is governed by hopping between different grains. The elec- tronic properties of such systems have been studied for many years; 1 nevertheless many issues related to the conduction mechanism are still poorly understood. The case in which the metallic grains are ferromagnetic is of special interest since these systems have been found to exhibit a giant magnetore- sistance GMR effect due to spin dependent tunneling be- tween grains. 2 A peculiar feature which is found in dilute discontinuous two-dimensional 2D Ni films is the occur- rence of sharp resistance jumps as a function of the applied magnetic field. 3 These were interpreted as the result of mag- netomechanical distortions at a bottleneck grain which domi- nates the transport in systems which are on the percolation edge. This model is based on the notion that the electric conductivity is governed by the resistance of a local configu- ration of few grains, although there are 10 9 grains in the system. Recently we tested this hypothesis by modeling the granular system by a network of random resistors and study- ing their transport properties using numerical simulations. 4 We found a good agreement with the experimental results. In this paper we further develop the model and compare it to a three-dimensional 3D sample. Granular samples for which measurements have been performed 3 were prepared by quench condensation, i.e., se- quential evaporation on a cryogenically cold nonpassivated substrate such as SiO2 under UHV conditions while monitor- ing the film's thickness and resistance. The measurements which are presented in Fig. 1a were performed by evapo- rating Ni on a 2 2m m 2 square between two large Ag pads so a two-probe electric contact configuration is obtained. The growth process was terminated at the point at which an elec- tric conductivity could first be detected across the sample.

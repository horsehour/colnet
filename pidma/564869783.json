Assessment and Reduction for the Chinese Railway System Under Floods","description":"The economy of China and the travel needs of its citizens depend significantly on the continuous and reliable services provided by its railway system. However, this system is subject to frequent natural hazards, such as floods, earthquakes, and debris flow. A mechanism to assess the railway system vulnerability under these hazards and the design of effective vulnerability reduction strategies are essential to the reliable functioning of the railway system. This paper proposes a comprehensive methodology to quantitatively assess the railway system vulnerability under floods using historical data and GIS technology. The proposed methodology includes a network representation of the railway system, the generation of flood event scenarios, a method to estimate railway link vulnerability, and a quantitative vulnerability value computation approach. The railway system vulnerability is evaluated in terms of its service disruption related to the number of interrupted trains and the durations of interruption. A vulnerability reduction maintenance strategy is proposed that simultaneously considers link vulnerability and number of trains using it. Numerical experiments show that the proposed vulnerability reduction strategy is more effective than other strategies. The methodology can be extended to assess the railway system vulnerability under other natural hazards. It is further helpful for identifying an effective way to distribute limited maintenance resources to a transportation network facing frequent natural hazards.","publicationCount":0,"publicationCountByYear":[],"citationCnt":0,"citationCountByYear":[],"rank":22821.0,"entityType":0},"dataVersion":"2019-01-11-prod"}

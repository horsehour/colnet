The spontaneous self-strati® cation occurs only when the large grains have a larger angle of repose than the small grains do. Conversely, we obtain only spontaneous self-segregation, that is the large grains are found preferentially near the bottom of the cell while the small grains are found near the top, when the large grains have a smaller angle of repose than the small grains. The observed strati® cation might be of relevance to explain similar strati® ed patterns observed in Aeolian rocks.","publicationCount":0,"publicationCountByYear":[],"citationCnt":0,"citationCountByYear":[],"rank":23134.0,"entityType":0},"dataVersion":"2019-01-11-prod"}

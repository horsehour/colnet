These models are characterized by self-similar voids that are delineated by narrow channels. The growth-site probability distributions for all the models are shown to have the same form, n(\\ensuremath{\\alpha},M)\\ensuremath{\\sim}exp{-(A/lnM)[\\ensuremath{\\alpha}-${\\mathrm{\\ensuremath{\\alpha}}}_{0}$(M)${]}^{2}$}, where n(\\ensuremath{\\alpha},M)d\\ensuremath{\\alpha} is the number of growth sites with \\ensuremath{\\alpha}-ln${\\mathit{p}}_{\\mathit{i}}$/lnM+d\\ensuremath{\\alpha}, ${\\mathit{p}}_{\\mathit{i}}$ is the growth probability at site i, M is the cluster mass, ${\\mathrm{\\ensuremath{\\alpha}}}_{0}$(M)==B lnM, and A,B are constants. We find the same form of the distribution for all members of the family of models, suggesting the possibility that it is a consequence of the channels and self-similar voids, and is independent of other details of the model. Our result is in accord with the recent calculations for DLA clusters by Schwarzer et al. [Phys. Rev.

Equilibrium and Charging Facility Locations for Electric Vehicles","description":"In this paper, the authors investigate the electric vehicle (EV) equilibrium and optimal deployment of charging locations subject to the range limitation. The problem is similar to a network design problem with traffic equilibrium, which is characterized by a bi-level model structure. The upper level objective is to optimally locate charging stations such that the total generalized cost of all users is minimized, where the user’s generalized cost includes two parts, travel time and energy consumption. The total generalized cost is a measure of the total societal cost. The lower level model seeks traffic equilibrium, in which the individual travelers minimize their private generalized cost. All the utilized paths have identical generalized cost while satisfying the range limitation constraint. In particular, the authors use origin-based flows to maintain the range limitation constraint at the path level without path enumeration. To obtain the global solution, the optimality condition of the lower level model is added to the upper level problem resulting in a single level model. The nonlinear travel time function is approximated by piecewise linear functions and thus eventually the problem is formulated as a mixed integer linear program. The authors use a real-sized network to analyze the model and illustrate that it can determine the optimal charging station locations in a planning context while factoring the EV users’ individual route choice behaviors.","publicationCount":0,"publicationCountByYear":[],"citationCnt":0,"citationCountByYear":[],"rank":22951.0,"entityType":0},"dataVersion":"2019-01-11-prod"}

We take as our measure of density the number of females of more than one year old in the study area; since the cessation of culling in 1973, density has risen from 57 to 178. Females produce at most one calf per year throughout their breeding lifespan, whereas male reproductive success shows greater variance; adult male weight is 1.7 times that of females, and male calves are heavier at birth 18 . All animals in the study population are individually recognizable; daily monitoring of the population during the calving season shows whether or not each female calved in a given year, and, if so, the sex of her offspring. An age-corrected dominance rank for each female, ranging from 0 to 1, is calculated from observations of interactions between pairs of individuals, as described elsewhere. 2 Females are also classified as to whether or not they reared a calf the previous year that survived to six months. Average temperature and total rainfall in the following periods were considered: August to October, November to January, February to March. None of the weather variables showed consistent change over the study period. We report two forms of statistical analysis. The proportion of males born each year (referred to as the annual birth sex ratio) was related to density and weather measures using simple linear regression (normality of errors was satisfied; 1973 was excluded owing to incomplete data collection). The probability that an individual calf was male and the probability that a female gave birth in a given year were analysed using generalized linear mixed models 28","publicationCount":0,"publicationCountByYear":[],"citationCnt":1647,"citationCountByYear":[],"rank":17642.0,"entityType":0},"dataVersion":"2019-01-11-prod"}

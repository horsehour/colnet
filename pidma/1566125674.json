In response to the network disruption caused by the bridge collapse, a number of traffic restoration projects were proposed and rapidly implemented by Mn/DOT. Selection and prioritization of these projects, however, was based mainly on engineering judgment and experience. The only decision-support tool available to traffic engineers was the regional transportation planning model, which is static in nature and decennial. In this work, the Twin Cities metropolitan area is simulated using a mesoscopic traffic simulator in the AIMSUN software. After establishing the mesoscopic simulation model, the authors attempt to utilize the calibrated mesoscopic simulation model to evaluate driversâ€™ perceived cost evolution to explain the traffic dynamics on the Twin Cities road network after the unexpected collapse of the I-35W Bridge over the Mississippi River. Given the observation of largely underutilized sections of network, it is proposed that the tragedy generated a perceived travel cost to discourage commuters from using these sections. Applying a mesoscopic simulation model provided by AIMSUN, the perceived costs on cordon lines after the I-35W Bridge collapse were suggested to be best described as an exponential decay cost curve. The proposed model is applicable to both practitioners and researchers in traffic-related fields by providing an understanding of how traffic dynamics will evolve after a long-term, unexpected network disruption.","publicationCount":0,"publicationCountByYear":[],"citationCnt":0,"citationCountByYear":[],"rank":23716.0,"entityType":0},"dataVersion":"2019-01-11-prod"}

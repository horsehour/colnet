The rate of C. difficile infection (CDI) in the United States has been increasing since 2000, and CDI caused an estimated 336,565 cases in 2009.4 In some healthcare facilities, CDI has eclipsed methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus as the leading source of HAI.5 Of special concern is the development of recurrent CDI, which may be a complicated, long-term condition typified by repeated bouts of severe diarrhea.\r\n\r\nBecause altering the indigenous microbiota of the intestinal tract causes CDI, there has been an interest in recolonizing the intestinal tract with introduced donor bacteria obtained from either healthy donor stool6,7 or a synthetically derived pure culture.8 This procedure, referred to as fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), restores the bacterial ecology that keeps C. difficile in check. Both uncontrolled case reports7,8 and a small clinical trial6 have shown encouraging results; however, FMT is still largely reserved for specialized intervention in difficult or refractory cases. Furthermore, the implications of routine intestinal recolonization as a standard course of treatment for the prevention of recurrent or incident CDI have not been widely explored. The need for an increased understanding of the potential effects and utility of FMT is especially urgent in light of the US Food and Drug Administration’s increased interest in the procedure and their decision that it falls under the agency’s regulatory purview.9\r\n\r\nMathematical models are ideal for studying such hypothetical scenarios. They can provide a repeatable, quantitative environment with which to evaluate evidence, guide policy creation, discover critical thresholds upon which the success of interventions may depend, and suggest new directions for observational studies and clinical trials. These strengths are difficult or impossible to duplicate with empirical research within a hospital. Critically, one patient’s outcome influences another’s exposure, which violates traditional statistical assumptions of independence. Finally, mathematical models are capable of scaling up the independent, individual-level observations that emerge from clinical research to the population level. In this way, we may study how these individuals interact with one another and influence the transmission process without a risk to patient safety. To evaluate the impact of routine intestinal microbiota recolonization in patients with CDI, we developed a mathematical model that describes the transmission of C. difficile within an intensive care unit (ICU) and has the capability to test the impact of FMT on prevention of recurrent or initial C. difficile infection due to in-hospital transmission.","publicationCount":0,"publicationCountByYear":[],"citationCnt":17,"citationCountByYear":[],"rank":20213.0,"entityType":0},"dataVersion":"2019-01-11-prod"}

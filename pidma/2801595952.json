However, these kind of strategies usually do not consider that medical institutes may have limited vaccine resources available. In this manuscript, we explore the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model with local dynamic vaccination, and considering limited vaccines. In this model, susceptibles in contact with an infected individual, are vaccinated -with probability $\\omega$- and then getting infected -with probability $\\beta$. However, when the fraction of immunized individuals reaches a threshold $V_L$, the vaccination stops, after which only the infection is possible. In the steady state, besides the critical points $\\beta_c$ and $\\omega_c$ that separate a non-epidemic from an epidemic phase, we find for a range of $V_L$ another transition points, $\\beta^*>\\beta_c$ and $\\omega^*<\\omega_c$, which correspond to a novel discontinuous phase transition. This critical value separates a phase where the amount of vaccines is sufficient, from a phase where the disease is strong enough to exhaust all the vaccination units. For a disease with fixed $\\beta$, the vaccination probability $\\omega$ can be controlled in order to drastically reduce the number of infected individuals, using efficiently the available vaccines. \r\nFurthermore, the temporal evolution of the system close to $\\beta^*$ or $\\omega^*$, shows that after a peak of infection the system enters into a quasi-stationary state, with only a few infected cases. But if there are no more vaccines, these few infected individuals could originate a second outbreak, represented by a second peak of infection. This state of apparent calm, could be dangerous since it may lead to misleading conclusions and to an abandon of the strategies to control the disease.","publicationCount":0,"publicationCountByYear":[],"citationCnt":1,"citationCountByYear":[],"rank":20934.0,"entityType":0},"dataVersion":"2019-01-11-prod"}

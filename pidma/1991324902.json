polymers in the presence of impurities.","description":"We study branched polymers in the presence of impurities using the branched polymer growth model, which has been proposed by Lucena et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 72, 230 (1994)]. To avoid boundary effects we study the growth process in chemical l-space and determine the structural exponents ${\\mathit{d}}_{\\mathit{l}}$, ${\\mathit{d}}_{\\mathrm{min}}$, and \\ensuremath{\\tau}. For d=2 (square lattice) and d=3 (simple cubic lattice) our results are based on numerical simulations, while for the Bethe lattice (d=\\ensuremath{\\infty}) the quantities of interest were obtained analytically. These results support our recent suggestion that on the critical line the branched polymers belong to the universality class of percolation. \\textcopyright{} 1996 The American Physical Society.","publicationCount":0,"publicationCountByYear":[],"citationCnt":2,"citationCountByYear":[],"rank":22376.0,"entityType":0},"dataVersion":"2019-01-11-prod"}

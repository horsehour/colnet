In our earlier work, the comb was assumed to have a deterministic structure, the comb having teeth of infinite length. In the present paper we study diffusion on a one-dimensional random comb, the length of whose teeth are random variables with an asymptotic stable law distribution \\ensuremath{\\varphi}(L)\\ensuremath{\\sim}${L}^{\\mathrm{\\ensuremath{-}}(1+\\ensuremath{\\gamma})}$ where 0l\\ensuremath{\\gamma}\\ensuremath{\\le}1. Two mean-field methods are used for the analysis, one based on the continuous-time random walk, and the second a self-consistent scaling theory. Both lead to the same conclusions. We find that the diffusion exponent characterizing the mean-square displacement along the backbone of the comb is ${d}_{w}$=4/(1+\\ensuremath{\\gamma}) for \\ensuremath{\\gamma}l1 and ${d}_{w}$=2 for \\ensuremath{\\gamma}\\ensuremath{\\ge}1. The probability of being at the origin at time t is ${P}_{0}$(t)\\ensuremath{\\sim}${t}^{\\mathrm{\\ensuremath{-}}{d}_{s}/2}$ for large t with ${d}_{s}$=(3-\\ensuremath{\\gamma})/2 for \\ensuremath{\\gamma}l1 and ${d}_{s}$=1 for \\ensuremath{\\gamma}g1. When a field is applied along the backbone of the comb the diffusion exponent is ${d}_{w}$=2/(1+\\ensuremath{\\gamma}) for \\ensuremath{\\gamma}l1 and ${d}_{w}$=1 for \\ensuremath{\\gamma}\\ensuremath{\\ge}1. The theoretical results are confirmed using the exact enumeration method.","publicationCount":0,"publicationCountByYear":[],"citationCnt":25,"citationCountByYear":[],"rank":21788.0,"entityType":0},"dataVersion":"2019-01-11-prod"}

A large discontinuity appears at the transition temperature ${T}_{c}$ indicating a well-defined first-order transition. A new feature of the data is a dome-shaped figure above ${T}_{c}$, resembling the magnetic susceptibility of many antiferromagnetic materials. Extension of a well-known pseudospin model for K${\\mathrm{H}}_{2}$P${\\mathrm{O}}_{4}$ to the transverse direction is achieved by taking into account the direct contribution of the displacements of the protons to the transverse polarization. Calculation of the transverse susceptibility for this model within the four-cluster approximation leads to a new independent determination of the Slater-Takagi energy configuration parameters ${\\ensuremath{\\epsilon}}_{0}$ and $\\ensuremath{\\epsilon}$.

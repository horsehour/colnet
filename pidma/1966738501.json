A link between two sites represents the cross-correlations between the records of each site. We find that within the different phases of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) the correlation values of the links in the climate network are significantly different. By setting an optimized threshold on the correlation values, we find that the number of strong links in the network increases during times of positive NAO indices, and decreases during times of negative NAO indices. We find a pronounced sensitivity of the network structure to the NAO oscillations which is significantly higher compared to the observed response of spatial average of the climate records. Our results suggest a new measure that tracks the NAO pattern. Copyright c EPLA, 2012 Introduction. - A network approach has recently been applied in order to follow climate dynamics (1,2). The nodes of the climate network are geographical sites. The dynamics recorded in each site is composed of its intrinsic dynamics and the coupling with the dynamics of other sites. The cross-correlations due to the coupling between the dynamics in two different sites are represented in our network by a link between the sites (see (3) for a lab experiment that demonstrates the relation between the coupling and the correlation). The maximum value of the correlation might appear with a time delay between the two data records. The climate network approach has recently led to the discovery of several novel insights related to El-Nino dynamics (4-12).","publicationCount":0,"publicationCountByYear":[],"citationCnt":23,"citationCountByYear":[],"rank":20240.0,"entityType":0},"dataVersion":"2019-01-11-prod"}

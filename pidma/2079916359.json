This probability distribution is independent of the cluster’s length t up to d values comparable to the cluster’s width ;t n . The results are shown to be consistent with a tree description of the directed percolation clusters. PACS number~s!: 61.66.Dk, 64.60.Cn, 71.20.Be The subject of random walks on percolation clusters, known as the ‘‘ant in the labyrinth’’ problem @1#, has drawn quite intensive attention in the physical literature @2#. However, in spite of the numerous efforts, no simple connection was found between the static and dynamical exponents of percolation, though the Alexander-Orbach conjecture @3# comes close to this goal. In this article, it is shown that such a simple connection does exist in the special case of directed random walks on directed percolation clusters. In the directed percolation model @4#, there is a predefined direction in which the percolation clusters can grow. In the directed random walk considered in the present study, walks are also performed only in the same predefined direction. Balents and Kardar @5# have already studied random walks on directed percolation clusters, but while their main concern was the variability of distances between different clusters, the main concern of the present article is the variability of distances within each cluster. In order to study this issue, numerical results were obtained for directed random walks performed along twodimensional directed percolation clusters grown at the critical probability pc . These numerical results indicated that the distance d of the directed random walkers from their most probable end point is determined by a probability distribution p(d);d 2(11w/n) , where w.0.50 and n.0.63. This probability distribution is independent of the cluster’s length t up to d values comparable to the cluster’s width ;t n . The known values of these two exponents are shown to be consistent with a tree description of the directed percolation clusters. The article starts with a description of the model and the way the numerical data were gathered. The second part presents the numerical results which have similar characteristics to previous results @6# obtained for the directed polymer model @7,8#. This similarity is investigated further in the final part of the article. The connection between the directed percolation model and the directed polymer model was studied in a number of articles @9‐13#, and the present study points to some similarity between entropy in the directed percolation model, and energy in the directed polymer model. On an arbitrary lattice structure, a directed percolation cluster can be defined as the set of lattice points ~sites! which are connected to some origin, while the connecting paths are oriented in a predefined direction ~thus all of them are of","publicationCount":0,"publicationCountByYear":[],"citationCnt":3,"citationCountByYear":[],"rank":21742.0,"entityType":0},"dataVersion":"2019-01-11-prod"}

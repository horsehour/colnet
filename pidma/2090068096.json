For the trapping case we find that the mass M scales with l as $M\\ensuremath{\\sim}{l}^{{d}_{l}}$ with ${d}_{l}=1.510\\ifmmode\\pm\\else\\textpm\\fi{}0.005$ and l scales with r as $l\\ensuremath{\\sim}{r}^{{d}_{\\mathrm{min}}}$ with ${d}_{\\mathrm{min}}=1.213\\ifmmode\\pm\\else\\textpm\\fi{}0.005,$ whereas in the nontrapping case ${d}_{l}=1.671\\ifmmode\\pm\\else\\textpm\\fi{}0.006$ and ${d}_{\\mathrm{min}}=1.133\\ifmmode\\pm\\else\\textpm\\fi{}0.005.$ These values further support previous results that NIP and TIP are in distinct universality classes. We also study numerically using scaling approaches the distribution $N(l,r)$ of the lengths of the shortest paths connecting two sites at distance r in NIP and TIP. We find that it obeys a scaling form $N(l,r)\\ensuremath{\\sim}{r}^{{d}_{f}\\ensuremath{-}1\\ensuremath{-}{d}_{\\mathrm{}\\mathrm{min}}}{f(l/r}^{{d}_{\\mathrm{min}}}).$ The scaling function has a power-law tail for large x values, $f(x)\\ensuremath{\\sim}{x}^{\\ensuremath{-}h},$ with a universal value of $h\\ensuremath{\\approx}2$ for both models within our numerical accuracy.","publicationCount":0,"publicationCountByYear":[],"citationCnt":8,"citationCountByYear":[],"rank":21957.0,"entityType":0},"dataVersion":"2019-01-11-prod"}

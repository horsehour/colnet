We show that signals with identical long-range correlations can exhibit different time organization for the magnitude and sign. We find that the magnitude series relates to the nonlinear properties of the original time series, while the sign series relates to the linear properties. We apply our approach to the heartbeat interval series and find that the magnitude series is long-range correlated, while the sign series is anticorrelated and that both magnitude and sign series may have clinical applications. A broad class of physical and biological systems exhibits complex dynamics, associated with the presence of many components interacting over a wide range of time or space scales. These often-competing interactions may generate an output signal with fluctuations that appear “noisy” and “erratic” but reveal scale-invariant structure. One general approach to study these systems is to analyze the ways that such fluctuations obey scaling laws [1—3]. Here, we take into account that the fluctuations in the dynamical output of any system can be characterized by their magnitude (absolute value) and their direction (sign). These two quantities reflect the underlying interactions in a system— the resulting “force” of these interactions at each moment determines the magnitude and the direction of the fluctuations. For an important representative of complex dynamics — human heartbeat intervals — we find unexpected results for the time ordering of the heartbeat interval fluctuations by studying the scaling properties of their magnitude and sign. We also demonstrate that fluctuations following identical long-range correlations can exhibit very different time ordering for the magnitude and sign. We consider the time series formed by consecutive cardiac interbeat intervals (Fig. 1a) and focus on the correlations in the time increments between consecutive beats. This time series is of general interest, in part because it is the output of a complex integrated control system, including competing stimuli from the neuroautonomic nervous system [4]. These stimuli modulate the rhythmicity of the heart’s intrinsic pacemaker, leading to complex fluctuations. Previous reports indicate that these fluctuations exhibit scale-invariant properties, and are anticorrelated over a broad range of time scales (i.e., the power spectrum follows a power-law where the amplitudes of the higher frequencies are dominant) [5,6]. The time series of the fluctuations in heartbeat intervals can be “decomposed” into two different time series. We analyze separately the time series formed by the magnitude and the sign of the increments in the time intervals","publicationCount":0,"publicationCountByYear":[],"citationCnt":413,"citationCountByYear":[],"rank":18828.0,"entityType":0},"dataVersion":"2019-01-11-prod"}

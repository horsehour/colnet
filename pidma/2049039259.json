We generalize the consequent formalism by incorporating a rudimentary model of momentum effects, based on a persistent random-walk model. This formulation is used to study some properties of the reaction A + B - C with the reactant species initially separated in space. It is shown that the change in dynamics introduces an additional short-time scaling regime in the behavior of the reaction rate. Many aspectsofthetheoryofthekineticsofdiffusion-controlled reactions are by now well understood, and some of the simpler of these, of particular interest to the physical chemist, aredescribed in the book by Rice.’ The work described in that monograph relates entirely to the kinetics of reactions that occur in a volume and a dimension which ensures perfect mixing of the reactants. After the seminal work of Ovchinnikov and Zeldovich,2 who showed that chemical reactions that occur in a medium in which perfect mixing is hindered might be expected not to be describable by classical kinetic laws, Raoul Kopelman, together with his many collaborators, fleshed out the many ramifications of this general observation.3-10 Raoul’s work, based on computer simulations, theory, and experimental observations, has generally been directed at elucidating changes in kinetic behavior attributable to the inability of reactants to fully mix in low dimensional geometries. This has the important consequence that the classical formulation of kinetic equations in terms of spatially uniform reactant concentrations cannot be valid when mixing is incomplete. A summary of much of the recent research on reactions in lower dimensions can be found in a special issue of the Journal of Statistical Physics.’’ In the present paper we describe some effects that follow from the incorporation of momentum into the model system A + B C with an initial separation of the reactant species. This process is generally more readily amenable to experimental studies than similar nonconvective systems with initially uniformly mixed reactants, a condition which is difficult to achieve in a real chemical system. The initial separation of reactants leads to formation of a dynamic reaction front, a spatially localized region where the reaction occurs, which can be visualized and measured. The presence of a reaction interface is a characteristic of many processes in nature and has been the subject of many recent experimental8-10 and theoretica112-28 studies. The following set of mean-field-type reaction-diffusion equations for the local concentrations pa and Pb has been assumed to describe the system12","publicationCount":0,"publicationCountByYear":[],"citationCnt":6,"citationCountByYear":[],"rank":22492.0,"entityType":0},"dataVersion":"2019-01-11-prod"}

Value of Travel Time and Value of Reliability Using Dynamic Toll Data","description":"This study applied a new methodology to dynamic toll data for evaluating drivers’ value of travel time (VOT) and value of reliability (VOR). Previous studies were generally based on drivers’ behavior data from stated preference and revealed preference surveys that are costly to collect, from loop detector data that are hard to account for drivers’ route choice, or from global positioning system (GPS) data that require additional devices installed. This study proposed a new approach to estimate drivers’ value of travel time and its reliability based on dynamic toll information collected from I-394, Minnesota. Compared with other types of data sources, it is reliable and easy to collect the drivers’ route choice data without additional equipment installed. After analyzing traffic pattern changes, the authors estimated VOT and VOR distributions for each weekday, based on the toll records of the MnPASS system. The authors found that MnPASS users valued travel time reliability more than travel time savings. The authors also observed that the estimated VOT and VOR were higher on Friday than other weekdays.","publicationCount":0,"publicationCountByYear":[],"citationCnt":4,"citationCountByYear":[],"rank":22508.0,"entityType":0},"dataVersion":"2019-01-11-prod"}

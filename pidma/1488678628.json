Urban Development in Tel Aviv, Based on Its Morphology Alone","description":"It is possible to understanding the spatial behavior and structure of cities based on urban morphology alone. The units of analysis are urban clusters, defined as contiguous built-up urban areas instead of municipalities defined by politically determined boundaries. By means of historic data of the Tel-Aviv metropolis we present analyses of urban cluster statistics from 1935 to 2000. We focus on the largest cluster which includes the city of Tel-Aviv and several surrounding municipalities. The results suggest anomalies in the years 1964 and 1985. Based on the character of cities as self organizing systems, our study suggests that the analysis of urban cluster dynamics is an efficient tool to study urban phenomena. Introduction The spatial evolution of cities has been the subject of many studies for over a century. Previous work attempted to find explanations for the way cities evolve and arrange themselves in space, based on data collected at the municipal level (Jefferson, 1939; Zipf, 1941; Anas et al, 1998). In reality, however, the spatial evolution of cities extends beyond municipal boundaries. The nature ofthe data used in past studies created distortions in the description of urban phenomena and in tests of hypotheses. Furthermore, the models used to study urban dynamics, whether they originated in fields of cultural studies, politics, sociology, or economics, utilized unrealistic mathematical functions (Christaller, 1933; Alonso, 1964). Thus, no existing model provides a complete and precise explanation ofthe physical similarity found among urban structures (Batty & Longley, 1994). Recent research has illustrated that it is useful to think of cities as self-organizing (Batty and Longley, 1994; Portugali, 2000). The presented work relies on this conception of cities and the fact that urban morphology is amenable to mathematical description and analysis. It utilizes concepts and tools from theories of complexity, self-organization, chaos, and fractal geometry. Previous work has shown that urban areas can be characterized as fractals (Batty & Longley, 1987, 1994; Batty et al, 1989; Frankhauser, 1990, 1994; Batty & Xie, 1996; Shen, 1997, 2002; White & Engelen, 1993; White et al, 2001). Makse et al. (1 995) proposed a percolation model that relates the morphology of built areas to the location decisions of its population. Benguigui et al (2001a) developed a cellular automaton model that simulated the development of the footprint of the built areas in one city within the Tel- Aviv metropolis. Patterns of urban morphology exhibit similarity to phenomena known in physics as cluster formation. This led to the hypothesis that there may be a general explanation ofthe arrangement of these structures in space (Schweitzer, 1997). In a previous work we presented an approach to understanding the spatial distribution and structure of cities based on morphology alone (Benguigui et al, 2006). The novelty in this approach is the replacement of municipalities as units of examination by urban clusters, defined as contiguous built areas. This enabled us to ignore changes ofthe cities' boundaries that are related to political decisions rather than to real changes in the city spatial distribution. In this study we focus on the largest cluster in the Tel- Aviv metropolis and show how changes in its morphology might be used to identify socio-economic changes. This is as the largest cluster is compounded of the core city of the metropolis (i.e., Tel Aviv) and its surrounding municipalities. This agglomeration of cities works as the financial, political, and cultural center of the metropolis and in many terms ofthe entire country. The next section provides a methodological discussion at the backdrop of the research. Section 3 focuses on the analysis of the morphology of the largest cluster. The discussion in Section 4 relates the mathematical results with socio-economic phenomena in the history of the Tel-Aviv metropolis. …","publicationCount":0,"publicationCountByYear":[],"citationCnt":1,"citationCountByYear":[],"rank":22604.0,"entityType":0},"dataVersion":"2019-01-11-prod"}

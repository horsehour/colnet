A four-cluster approximation to the Glauber equations of motion for the $E$-mode pseudospin fluctuations is employed. It is found that these fluctuations have three different relaxation times below ${T}_{c}$ and two above ${T}_{c}$ However, in the low-frequency region the dynamical susceptibility has a Debye-type frequency dependence with one relaxation time ${\\ensuremath{\\tau}}_{x}$. The temperature dependence of ${\\ensuremath{\\tau}}_{x}$ is calculated within the present model and is compared to that derived from the randomphase approximation (RPA). It is found that the relation between ${\\ensuremath{\\tau}}_{x}$ and the static transverse susceptibility ${\\ensuremath{\\chi}}_{x}$ is markedly different from the RPA result ${\\ensuremath{\\tau}}_{x}\\ensuremath{\\propto}T{\\ensuremath{\\chi}}_{x}$. The present theory explains in a consistent way the available experimental data on the dynamical properties of K${\\mathrm{D}}_{2}$P${\\mathrm{O}}_{4}$ in both the longitudinal and transverse directions.","publicationCount":0,"publicationCountByYear":[],"citationCnt":7,"citationCountByYear":[],"rank":23704.0,"entityType":0},"dataVersion":"2019-01-11-prod"}

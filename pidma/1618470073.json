In reality, many real-world networks interact with other networks. Here we develop an analytical framework forstudying interacting networks and present an exact percolation law for a network of ninterdependent networks. In particular, weﬁnd that for nErdos-R´enyi networks each of average degree k, the giant component, P ∞ , is given by P ∞ = p[1−exp(−kP ∞ )] n where 1 −p is the initial fraction of removed nodes. Our general result coincides for n = 1 with the known Erdos-R´enyisecond-order phase transition for a single network. For any n ≥ 2 cascading failures occur and the transition becomes aﬁrst-order percolation transition. The new law for P ∞ shows that percolation theory that is extensively studied in physics andmathematics is a limiting case (n= 1) of a more general general and diﬀerent percolation law for interdependent networks. In recent years dramatic advances in the ﬁeld of com-plex networks have occurred [1–13]. The internet, airlineroutes, and electric power grids are all examples of net-works whose function relies crucially on the connectivitybetween the network components. An important prop-erty of such systems is their robustness to node failures.Almost all research has been concentrated on the caseof a single or isolated network which does not interactwith other networks. Recently, based on the motivationthat modern infrastructures are becoming signiﬁcantlymore dependent on each other, a system of two coupledinterdependent networks has been studied [14]. A funda-mental property of interdependent networks is that whennodes in one network fail, they may lead to the failureof dependent nodes in other networks which may causefurther damage in the ﬁrst network and so on, leading toa global cascade of failures. Buldyrev et al. [14] devel-oped a framework for analyzing robustness of two inter-acting networks subject to such cascading failures. Theyfound that interdependent networks become signiﬁcantlymore vulnerable compared to their noninteracting coun-terparts.For many important examples, more than two net-works depend on each other. For example, diverse infras-tructures are coupled together, such as water and foodsupply, communications, fuel, ﬁnancial transactions, andpower stations [15–18]. For further examples see SectionI in the Supplementary Information (SI). Understandingthe robustness due to such interdependencies is one of themajor challenges for designing resilient infrastructures.We introduce here a model system, comprising a net-work of n coupled networks, where each network con-sists of N nodes (See Fig. 1). The N nodes in eachnetwork are connected to nodes in neighboring networksby bidirectional dependency links, thereby establishing aone-to-one correspondence as illustrated in Fig. 2 in SI.We develop a mathematical framework to study the ro-bustness of this “network of networks” (NON). We ﬁndan exact analytical law for percolation of a NON systemcomposed of n coupled randomly connected networks.Our result generalizes the known Erdo˝s-R´enyi (ER) [19–21] result for the giant component of a single networkand the n = 2 result found recently [14], and shows thatwhile for n = 1 the percolation transition is a second or-der transition, for n > 1 cascading failures occur and thetransition becomes a ﬁrst order transition. Our resultsfor n interdependent networks suggest that the classi-cal percolation theory extensively studied in physics andmathematics is a limiting case of a general theory of per-colation in NONs, or networks with multiple types ofconnectivity links. This general theory has many novelfeatures which are not present in classical percolation.Additionally, we ﬁnd:(i) the robustness of NON signiﬁcantly decreases withn, and(ii) for a network of n ER networks all with the sameaverage degree k, there exists a minimum degree k","publicationCount":0,"publicationCountByYear":[],"citationCnt":430,"citationCountByYear":[],"rank":18080.0,"entityType":0},"dataVersion":"2019-01-11-prod"}

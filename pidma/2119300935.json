The exponents characterizing the density evolution as a function of time are considerably higher than 1, implying that both reactions occur at a much faster rate. This is due to the fact that the discerning effects of the generation of a depletion zone (AA) and the segregation of the reactants (AB) do not occur at all as in normal spaces. Instead we observe the formation of clusters of A (AA reaction) and of mixed A and B (AB reaction) around the hubs of the network. Only at the limit of very sparse networks is the usual behavior recovered. The model bimolecular chemical reactions of the A � A and AB types have been heavily studied since the pioneer work of Ovchinnikov and Zeldovich (1), postu- lating a behavior drastically different than the mean-field predictions, especially in low dimensions and in fractal structures. These were verified additionally by numerical simulations, which showed pictorially the dominating effect in these two systems, i.e., the generation of the depletion zone for the AA type shown by Torney and McConnell (2), and the spatial segregation of the two types of reactants in the AB type shown by Toussaint and Wilczek (3). In the past 20 years a large number of works extended these initial ideas and explained in detail how these effects come about, showed the existence of several temporal regimes, explained the crossovers be- tween the early-time and long-time behavior, and a wealth of other information, rendering these systems as some of the most heavily studied systems of interacting particles (4). Classically, the mean-field prediction for the density � of the surviving particles in AA and equimolar AB type reactions is","publicationCount":0,"publicationCountByYear":[],"citationCnt":88,"citationCountByYear":[],"rank":20441.0,"entityType":0},"dataVersion":"2019-01-11-prod"}

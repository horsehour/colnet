Reservation System Design and Its Application to Freight Transportation","description":"Congestion and safety associated with freight trucks are key issues that arise in the context of highway transportation, especially in the heavily-traveled commercial corridors. To address these issues, truck-only lanes for freight trucks have been proposed as a solution to improve the productivity and reduce congestion, safety hazards and emissions. Truck-only lanes combined with a reservation system can potentially enable efficient operations and reliable demand management to guarantee high quality of service. In this regard, a reservation system with a real options approach can address key issues associated with the user-pays principle (i.e., the beneficiaries of truck-only lanes pay the toll) and fair reservation fees for both highway operators and the users for truck-only lanes. This research seeks to develop an option-pricing mechanism consistent with the highway systemâ€™s operation and to formulate a closed-form pricing-function on reservation options on truck-only lanes to guarantee a threshold level of service, given the vulnerability associated with system management failure.","publicationCount":0,"publicationCountByYear":[],"citationCnt":0,"citationCountByYear":[],"rank":23739.0,"entityType":0},"dataVersion":"2019-01-11-prod"}

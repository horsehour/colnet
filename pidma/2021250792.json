To answer this question, we consider all 33 301 coding and all 29 453 noncoding eukaryotic sequences\\char22{}each of length larger than 512 base pairs (bp\\char22{}in the present release of the GenBank to determine whether there is any statistically significant distinction in their long-range correlation properties. Standard fast Fourier transform (FFT) analysis indicates that coding sequences have practically no correlations in the range from 10 bp to 100 bp (spectral exponent \\ensuremath{\\beta}=0.00\\ifmmode\\pm\\else\\textpm\\fi{}0.04, where the uncertainty is two standard deviations). In contrast, for noncoding sequences, the average value of the spectral exponent \\ensuremath{\\beta} is positive (0.16\\ifmmode\\pm\\else\\textpm\\fi{}0.05), which unambiguously shows the presence of long-range correlations. We also separately analyze the 874 coding and the 1157 noncoding sequences that have more than 4096 bp and find a larger region of power-law behavior. We calculate the probability that these two data sets (coding and noncoding) were drawn from the same distribution and we find that it is less than ${10}^{\\mathrm{\\ensuremath{-}}10}$. We obtain independent confirmation of these findings using the method of detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA), which is designed to treat sequences with statistical heterogeneity, such as DNA's known mosaic structure (``patchiness'') arising from the nonstationarity of nucleotide concentration. The near-perfect agreement between the two independent analysis methods, FFT and DFA, increases the confidence in the reliability of our conclusion.","publicationCount":0,"publicationCountByYear":[],"citationCnt":662,"citationCountByYear":[],"rank":19192.0,"entityType":0},"dataVersion":"2019-01-11-prod"}

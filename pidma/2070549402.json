Although it is generally accepted that such networks are very sensitive to targeted attacks, we show that for a particular type of structure such networks surprisingly remain very robust even under removal of a large fraction of their nodes, which in some cases can be up to 70%. The degree distribution P(k) of these structures is such that for small values of the degree k the distribution is constant with k, up to a critical value kc, and thereafter it decays with k with the usual power law. We describe in detail a model for such a scale-free network with this modified degree distribution, and we show both analytically and via simulations, that this model can adequately describe all the features and breakdown characteristics of these attacks. We have found several experimental networks with such features, such as for example the IMDB actors collaboration network or the citations network, whose resilience to attacks can be accurately described by our model.","publicationCount":0,"publicationCountByYear":[],"citationCnt":4,"citationCountByYear":[],"rank":22299.0,"entityType":0},"dataVersion":"2019-01-11-prod"}

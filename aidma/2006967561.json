Kaveh","description":"Prof. Moshe Kaveh is the President, Member of Board of Trustees, and Member of Executive Committee of Bar-Ilan University. He is a central figure in Israeli academia, an internationally-acclaimed physicist, and one of the most prominent leaders of the global Jewish community. As Rector, and later President, of Bar-Ilan University over the past decade, Prof. Kaveh has led the University to a series of achievements that are unparalleled in Israeli academia. Over his tenure, ... Bar-Ilan University doubled its student body (today numbering over 30,000), tripled its doctoral students (from 500 to 1,500), and built 15 new teaching and research facilities including buildings for advanced technology in physics, psychology, cancer research, fertility research, interdisciplinary medical diagnostics, Jewish studies, music, brain studies, engineering, commercial law, philosophy and ethics, and international conferences – effectively doubling the size of the campus. In 2004 he received the Rotary Israel Award for the Advancement of Higher Education. Under Prof. Kaveh's leadership more than 120 new courses of study, research centers, academic chairs and institutes were established at the university, including a 1,000-student engineering school. He also established a multi-disciplinary brain research center, Israel's largest. During his tenure, Bar-Ilan University absorbed more than 100 new immigrant scientists from the former Soviet Union. He also initiated a pioneer academic studies program for Ultra-Orthodox Jews, in order to assist in the difficult adjustment by this community to the modern workplace. Unanimously re-elected in June 2005 for another term of office, Prof. Kaveh is now establishing Israel’s largest institute for nanotechnology, and will be changing the face of Bar-Ilan’s scientific efforts through the recruitment of fifty new experimentalists. The President’s commitment to advancing Judaism and democracy is also at the head of the flagship projects that he has set out as the challenge for the next five years. Prof. Kaveh has played a central role in the development of the system of higher education in Israel. He has recently concluded his third term as chairman of the Council of Israeli University Presidents. In this capacity, he was central to the development of the long-term budget plan for Israeli university development which was submitted by the Council to the government. In the current austerity period which Israel is undergoing, Prof. Kaveh has carefully guided Bar-Ilan University through difficult cutbacks and has balanced its budget. Fearlessly outspoken, Prof. Kaveh is considered one of the most original leaders of today’s “Modern Orthodox“ Jewish religious community worldwide. He has been a resolute advocate of enlightened and open religious education, including advanced Torah education for women. Prof. Kaveh has said that “we need religious education that prepares our young to tackle the challenges of the larger world, not education that teaches them fear of, and insularity from, the modern world.” In Israel, Prof. Kaveh has lobbied for support of the Neeman Commission’s recommendations for compromise on Jewish conversion procedures; opposed coercive religious legislation in the Israeli parliament; backed-up the Israeli Supreme Court in face of assaults on its integrity by Ultra-Orthodox politicians; and has relentlessly pursued and promoted Jewish unity. Prof. Kaveh is best known for his “three rules” for global Jewry unity: the importance of Klal Yisrael (national cohesion); the centrality of kevod habriot (tolerance and mutual respect); and the primacy of peace between Jews over truth (his personal conviction.) In 2000, Prof. Kaveh formulated the “Ten Commandments for Modern Orthodoxy“. An expert in disordered systems, solid state physics, theories of chaos in matter, and the miniaturization of electronic devices, Prof. Kaveh is the author of 250 scientific articles. His 1971 doctoral thesis disproved “Bloch's Law“ – a key thesis of modern physics relating to the electrical conductivity of metals -- which had been established in 1928 by Nobel laureate Prof. Felix Bloch. Together with the late Nobel Laureate Sir Neville Mott, Prof. Kaveh was honored by the Royal Society of England for developing a new approach in transforming insulators into metals. Prof. Kaveh received many national and international prizes for his outstanding achievements in physics. Prof. Kaveh is a research fellow at the Cavendish Laboratories at Cambridge University and an honorary member of the Russian Federation Academy of Sciences. He serves as chief scientist of Bar-Ilan University’s Minerva Center in Mesoscopics, and director of the Resnick Institute for Advanced Technology, a home for the absorption and retraining of outstanding Russian immigrant scientists. Before assuming the presidency of Bar-Ilan University in 1996, Prof. Kaveh served as Chairman of the Physics Department, as Dean of the Faculty of Natural Sciences, and as Rector of the University. He is currently serving a third term as President of the Council of University Presidents, and in this capacity, Prof. Kaveh is charting the path of higher education in Israel, fervently advancing agendas of academic and scientific excellence at the national policy-making level. Moshe Kaveh was born in 1943 in Tashkent, to which his family had fled from Warsaw to escape the Nazis. His late father, Rabbi David Kaveh, was the only one of eleven brothers to survive the Holocaust. The Kaveh family moved to Israel in 1950. Prof. Kaveh served in the IDF's Nahal brigade, combining military service with agricultural work on a kibbutz. Moshe Kaveh and his wife, Dorit, have four children and five grandchildren.","publicationCount":164,"publicationCountByYear":[{"count":1,"year":2018},{"count":4,"year":2017},{"count":4,"year":2016},{"count":4,"year":2015},{"count":2,"year":2014},{"count":1,"year":2002},{"count":1,"year":2001},{"count":2,"year":1999},{"count":4,"year":1998},{"count":5,"year":1997},{"count":4,"year":1996},{"count":2,"year":1995},{"count":2,"year":1994},{"count":6,"year":1993},{"count":5,"year":1992},{"count":8,"year":1991},{"count":9,"year":1990},{"count":4,"year":1989},{"count":4,"year":1988},{"count":16,"year":1987},{"count":3,"year":1986},{"count":10,"year":1985},{"count":4,"year":1984},{"count":7,"year":1983},{"count":10,"year":1982},{"count":17,"year":1981},{"count":6,"year":1980},{"count":1,"year":1979},{"count":3,"year":1978},{"count":2,"year":1977},{"count":3,"year":1976},{"count":2,"year":1975},{"count":5,"year":1974},{"count":2,"year":1972},{"count":1,"year":1971}],"citationCnt":2111,"citationCountByYear":[{"count":4,"year":2019},{"count":39,"year":2018},{"count":50,"year":2017},{"count":39,"year":2016},{"count":33,"year":2015},{"count":43,"year":2014},{"count":43,"year":2013},{"count":24,"year":2012},{"count":32,"year":2011},{"count":38,"year":2010},{"count":44,"year":2009},{"count":22,"year":2008},{"count":44,"year":2007},{"count":33,"year":2006},{"count":25,"year":2005},{"count":51,"year":2004},{"count":33,"year":2003},{"count":51,"year":2002},{"count":44,"year":2001},{"count":41,"year":2000},{"count":78,"year":1999},{"count":77,"year":1998},{"count":60,"year":1997},{"count":57,"year":1996},{"count":45,"year":1995},{"count":63,"year":1994},{"count":107,"year":1993},{"count":88,"year":1992},{"count":160,"year":1991},{"count":98,"year":1990},{"count":64,"year":1989},{"count":62,"year":1988},{"count":85,"year":1987},{"count":24,"year":1986},{"count":66,"year":1985},{"count":90,"year":1984},{"count":13,"year":1983},{"count":8,"year":1982},{"count":35,"year":1981},{"count":13,"year":1980},{"count":5,"year":1979},{"count":8,"year":1978},{"count":15,"year":1977},{"count":12,"year":1976},{"count":21,"year":1975},{"count":13,"year":1974},{"count":5,"year":1973},{"count":5,"year":1972},{"count":1,"year":1971}],"websites":["https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=61113088&privcapId=5546418"],"rank":-14.902,"entityType":0},"dataVersion":"2019-01-11-prod"}

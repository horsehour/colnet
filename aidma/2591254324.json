He has made seminal contributions to statistical physics and is one of the pioneers of interdisciplinary science. His current research focuses on understanding the anomalous behavior of liquid water, but he had made fundamental contributions to complex systems, such as quantifying correlations among the constituents of the Alzheimer brain, and quantifying fluctuations in noncoding and coding DNA sequences, interbeat intervals of the healthy and diseased heart. He is one of the founding fathers of econophysics.","publicationCount":30,"publicationCountByYear":[{"count":3,"year":2016},{"count":1,"year":2015},{"count":1,"year":2013},{"count":1,"year":2011},{"count":2,"year":2010},{"count":1,"year":2008},{"count":1,"year":2007},{"count":2,"year":2005},{"count":2,"year":2004},{"count":3,"year":2003},{"count":4,"year":2002},{"count":2,"year":2001},{"count":4,"year":2000},{"count":1,"year":1998},{"count":1,"year":1997},{"count":1,"year":1996}],"citationCnt":412,"citationCountByYear":[{"count":3,"year":2019},{"count":41,"year":2018},{"count":33,"year":2017},{"count":37,"year":2016},{"count":18,"year":2015},{"count":25,"year":2014},{"count":46,"year":2013},{"count":28,"year":2012},{"count":36,"year":2011},{"count":29,"year":2010},{"count":14,"year":2009},{"count":19,"year":2008},{"count":14,"year":2007},{"count":16,"year":2006},{"count":14,"year":2005},{"count":16,"year":2004},{"count":2,"year":2003},{"count":12,"year":2002},{"count":5,"year":2001},{"count":4,"year":2000}],"websites":["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._Eugene_Stanley"],"rank":-16.966,"entityType":0},"dataVersion":"2019-01-11-prod"}

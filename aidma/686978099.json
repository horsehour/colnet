Shlesinger","description":"Michael F. Shlesinger (born August 8, 1948, Brooklyn, New York) is a physicist notable for his work in the area of nonlinear dynamics. He is the founder of the journal Fractals. His pioneering work in statistical predictions and descriptions of random and deterministic processes has influenced the physics of amorphous solids and glasses, classical mechanics, and biophysics. He is known as a proponent of fractal time and is also known for his work on fractal stochastic processes related to areas such as disordered materials and turbulence.","imageUrl":"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4e/MichaelFShlesinger.jpg","publicationCount":170,"publicationCountByYear":[{"count":1,"year":2018},{"count":1,"year":2017},{"count":2,"year":2013},{"count":2,"year":2012},{"count":2,"year":2009},{"count":5,"year":2008},{"count":3,"year":2007},{"count":6,"year":2006},{"count":5,"year":2005},{"count":8,"year":2004},{"count":7,"year":2003},{"count":4,"year":2002},{"count":5,"year":2001},{"count":5,"year":2000},{"count":3,"year":1999},{"count":3,"year":1998},{"count":6,"year":1997},{"count":5,"year":1996},{"count":6,"year":1995},{"count":1,"year":1994},{"count":3,"year":1993},{"count":6,"year":1992},{"count":8,"year":1991},{"count":5,"year":1990},{"count":6,"year":1989},{"count":7,"year":1988},{"count":6,"year":1987},{"count":8,"year":1986},{"count":5,"year":1985},{"count":6,"year":1984},{"count":6,"year":1983},{"count":6,"year":1982},{"count":2,"year":1981},{"count":5,"year":1980},{"count":4,"year":1979},{"count":2,"year":1978},{"count":3,"year":1977},{"count":2,"year":1976}],"citationCnt":8272,"citationCountByYear":[{"count":10,"year":2019},{"count":263,"year":2018},{"count":321,"year":2017},{"count":305,"year":2016},{"count":324,"year":2015},{"count":354,"year":2014},{"count":276,"year":2013},{"count":329,"year":2012},{"count":239,"year":2011},{"count":248,"year":2010},{"count":284,"year":2009},{"count":284,"year":2008},{"count":348,"year":2007},{"count":301,"year":2006},{"count":294,"year":2005},{"count":328,"year":2004},{"count":335,"year":2003},{"count":301,"year":2002},{"count":188,"year":2001},{"count":256,"year":2000},{"count":253,"year":1999},{"count":202,"year":1998},{"count":205,"year":1997},{"count":180,"year":1996},{"count":206,"year":1995},{"count":176,"year":1994},{"count":165,"year":1993},{"count":147,"year":1992},{"count":218,"year":1991},{"count":181,"year":1990},{"count":153,"year":1989},{"count":102,"year":1988},{"count":131,"year":1987},{"count":101,"year":1986},{"count":63,"year":1985},{"count":37,"year":1984},{"count":71,"year":1983},{"count":26,"year":1982},{"count":9,"year":1981},{"count":31,"year":1980},{"count":15,"year":1979},{"count":4,"year":1978},{"count":7,"year":1977},{"count":1,"year":1976}],"websites":["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_F._Shlesinger"],"rank":-14.143,"entityType":0},"dataVersion":"2019-01-11-prod"}
